  ZRHC-*

A constraint-based program to compute a zero-recombinant
haplotype configuration with many missing genotypes

Introduction:

This program is based on the linear system formulation over Z_2
for ZRHC proposed by Xiao et al. (SODA 2007, SIAM JCOMP 2009).
In particular, when some genotypes are missing the system of
equations becomes quadratic since some of the terms are not
constant anymore.
With this program, we transform the quadratic system (over Z_2)
into a set of Boolean constraints that are then passed to a
constraint solver in order to solve the problem.
The main aim of the program is to assess the feasibility of this
approach.
