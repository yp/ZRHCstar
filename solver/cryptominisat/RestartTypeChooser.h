@brief Chooses between MiniSat and GLUCOSE restart types&learnt clause evaluation

MiniSat style restart is geometric, and glucose-type is dynamic. MiniSat-type
learnt clause staistic is activity-based, glucose-type is glue-based. This
class takes as input a number of MiniSat restart's end results, computes some
statistics on them, and at the end, tells if we should use one type or the
other. Basically, it masures variable activity stability, number of xors
in the problem, and variable degrees.
